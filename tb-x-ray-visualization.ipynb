Grayscale is appropriate for X-ray images since they're already in black and white.\n","\n","**Preprocessing the Image**\n","\n","Histogram Equalization: Enhances the contrast of the image, making the TB area more visible. Gaussian Blur: Reduces noise in the image that might interfere with our analysis.\n","\n","**Segmenting the TB Area**\n","\n","used thresholding, which determines an optimal threshold value to separate the image into foreground and background. Connected component analysis finds regions that might be TB-affected areas. We filter the components by size to focus on significant areas.\n","\n","**Creating a Depth Map**\n","\n","created a depth map using the intensity values of the image. TB areas are typically denser and appear brighter in X-rays, which we use to create elevation. We use a distance transform to create a smooth transition from normal tissue to TB areas. The depth map is normalized to have values between 0 and 1.\n","\n","**3D Visualization**\n","\n","used matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities to create a surface plot. The X and Y coordinates correspond to the image dimensions. The Z coordinate represents height that comes from our depth map. We downsample the image for better performance since X-rays can be large. The plot is styled with a grayscale colormap to represent the original X-ray appearance.\n","\n","**Rotation for 3D Effect**\n","\n","added a functionality to rotate the 3D visualization, allowing to see the TB area from different angles. This helps understand the spatial characteristics of the TB affected area."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"83d1e31a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-26T15:36:09.769624Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-26T15:36:09.76876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-26T15:36:21.707227Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-26T15:36:21.706289Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.944537,"end_time":"2025-05-26T15:36:21.708447","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-26T15:36:09.76391","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting
